# Channel-Assignment-in-Wireless-Network
This work is a basic program that analyzes the impact of throughput values on different number channels. This program is only the initial program as a background for other wireless programs. The extended results of the development of this program are presented in [1].

Here, we use some paramater, i.e.
  1. Fading Channel is utilized with pathloss exponetial is 3.7
  2. Power Transmission of all APs are considered constant.
  3. Environmental noise is considered.

If you use this program in your work, please kindly cite my work:
