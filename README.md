# Channel-Assignment-in-Wireless-Network
This work is a basic program that analyzes the impact of throughput values on different number channels.

This program is only the initial program as a background for other wireless programs. The extended results of the development of this program are presented in [1].

Here, we use some paramater, i.e.
1. Indoor fading channel is utilized with pathloss exponetial is 3.7 (Follow: Study on New Radio Access Technology: Radio Frequency (RF) and Co-Existence Aspects (Release 14), document TR 38.803, Version 14.2.0, 3GPP, 2017)
2. Power Transmission of all APs are considered constant.
3. Environmental noise is considered.

If you use this program in your work, please kindly cite my work:
